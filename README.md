The project is deployed to Vercel [here](https://oleksandrs-next-cpa.vercel.app/)

You can deploy it yourself anywhere that supports Next.js, for example on Vercel just by creation of the copy of this repository and deploying it via Vercel console, with the enviroment variables, listed in the .env.example file together with the methods of their obtaining:

```
AUTH_SECRET=
```

Enter here any long anough string, generated by some password generator for example.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://oleksandrs-next-cpa.vercel.app
```

Enter the URL of your application, it's for email sending. For example, during development

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

#I used here Postgress DB provided for free by neon.tech. Get the connection string from there

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<database_owner_name><database_owner_password>@<project_specific_string>-pooler.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/<database_name>?sslmode=require
```

uncomment next line if you use Prisma <5.10, like I here

```
DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED=postgresql://<database_owner_name><database_owner_password>@<project_specific_string>.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/<database_name>?sslmode=require
```

For email sending I used Google SMTP.
Add as both these variables the Google email, used for email sending

```
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=<userName>@gmail.com
EMAIL_FROM=<userName>@gmail.com
```

```
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=
```

Enter here not your personal Google account password, but APPLICATION PASSWORD for that email, it can be found in Google settings.

For image storage I used Cloudinary for free.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
```

Cloud name, you can find in settings of Cloudinary, upon registering there.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOAD_PRESET=
```

Create a public upload preset on Cloudinary and enter it's name here.
